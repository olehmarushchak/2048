# 2048 Game

## Overview
This repository contains a web-based implementation of the popular 2048 game built using native JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The game is simple but highly addictive: merge tiles of the same value to create a tile with the number 2048!

You can play it in your browser without the need for any additional frameworks or libraries.

## Features
- Native JavaScript: No external libraries or frameworks required.
- Responsive Design: Built with CSS to ensure the game looks good on various screen sizes.
- Intuitive Controls: Use arrow keys to control the tiles.
- Tile Merging Logic: When two tiles of the same number collide, they merge into one tile with double the value.
- Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you merge tiles.

## How to Play
- Start the Game: Tiles with values of 2 and 4 will randomly appear on the grid.
- Move the Tiles: Use your keyboard's arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move all the tiles in the chosen direction.
- Merge Tiles: When two tiles of the same number collide, they will merge into a single tile with their values combined (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
- Winning the Game: Reach the tile with the value 2048 to win!
- Losing the Game: The game ends if no more valid moves can be made.

## Controls
- Arrow Keys: Move the tiles in the desired direction (up, down, left, or right).
